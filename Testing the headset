//We should look into the power because were not giving the headset power through the arduino just through
//the batteries it might have something to do with why were not recieving input

// Also let me double check that I didn't create any solder bridges when soldering because its very possible
//since soldering sucks 

//Also make sure I grounded it to the right place because i put it where the one website said to but the other
// Says to " Solder another wire to ground using the large solder pad where the batteries ground connection 
// is" 

// Make sure batteries are good because we know our luck with them 

//I know i soldered the recieving pin to the right spot we just have to check for solder bridges and also 
// solder ground to the right spot bc idk if I did or not
